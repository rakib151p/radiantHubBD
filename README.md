Motivation behind the project RadiantHub
----------------------------------------
Our project addresses the prevalent issues faced by people in Bangladesh when
visiting salons. Long wait times, uncertainty about whether a shop is open, or
difficulty in finding a reliable salon in a new city are common frustrations. We aim to
streamline the process by creating a comprehensive hub where customers can easily
find and book services from local salons. By providing a platform that showcases the
best service providers and allows for customizable booking slots, we will ensure
convenience, quality, and efficiency for every customer, transforming the salon
experience in Bangladesh.
